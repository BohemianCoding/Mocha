 * By default, the bridge can automatically release retained objects
 * when they fall out of scope. In order for this to work, methods that return
 * retained objects must have this property set to YES.
 * 
 * Methods loaded from BridgeSupport libraries that have proper retain
 * semantic annotations will have this property set automatically.
 * 
 * In addition, methods that follow the standard Cocoa ownership conventions will
 * have this method set automatically. This includes any method that begins with
 * -copy..., -init..., -new..., etc.
